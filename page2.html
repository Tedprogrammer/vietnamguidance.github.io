        <p>
            Vietnam's Tet Festival typically occurs in late January or early mid-February. Since it is based on the lunar calendar, the dates change from year to year. Tet Nguyen Dan is the full name of the holiday. In Vietnam, it is the most significant and extensively observed public holiday of the year. Vietnamese people use this time to pay tribute to their ancestors and celebrate the start of the Lunar New Year with their families. A special event for all family members to gather around, and enjoying a meal.

    <p>
        While many Asian nations observe the Mid-autumn Festival, which originated in China, the Vietnamese version has its own customs and myths. Our most well-known legend concerns a man by the name of Cui who held onto a mystical banyan tree as it soared to the moon. We claim that if you closely examine the full moon, you can make out a man's shadow seated behind a tree. Families all around Vietnam greet Tet Trung Thu by setting a platter of five fruits and pastries on our ancestral altar. On the night of the full moon, children assemble boisterous processions with colorful lanterns and visit their neighborhoods while singing.

    <p>
        The Hung Kings' Temple Festival is a seven-day show of appreciation for the Vietnamese people's proverbial forefathers. At Hung Temple in Phu Tho province, outside of Hanoi, the event is held on the tenth day of the third lunar month. A large procession of palanquins and drums ascends Nghia Linh mountain on that day, stopping at lesser temples along the way to make incense at the High Temple. Being the anniversary of the Hung Kings' passing makes it well-known. This festival has a significant connection to Vietnam's early history. The oldest mentions of the 18 Hung Kings may be found in early collections of myths and legends.
