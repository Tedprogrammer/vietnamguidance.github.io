    <div id="para1-5">
        <p>
            Around 1,600 islands and islets make up Ha Long Bay in the Gulf of Tonkin, creating an amazing panorama of limestone pillars. The majority of the islands are deserted and undisturbed by human presence due to their precipitous nature. The site's high level of ecological interest complements its exceptional aesthetic attractiveness.

    <div id="para2-5">
        <p>
            The vigorous march of advancement slows to a languid amble in Hoi An. The Thu Bon River meanders between deteriorating storefronts and weathered pagodas in this former trading harbor as sampans arrive and depart from the former ferry pier. Two-lane roads exit the Old Town through swaying rice fields and arrive at a foamy beach. Hoi An's easygoing beauty and lantern-lit nights may leave you utterly enchanted if you stay for a few days.

            Hoang Su Phi, Mu Cang Chai, and Sapa, three of Vietnam's most majestic mountain ranges, are fundamental when discussing the country's most breathtaking scenery. Vietnamese farmers, especially those in the Northern mountain region, have hundreds of years of expertise growing rice and have mastered terrain adaptation. As a result, Vietnam's famed rice terraces are a must-see tourist destination for anybody traveling there. They were created over a lengthy period of time and are noted for their distinctive culture.

    </div><br>
    <div id="para4-5">
        <p>
            This 150-meter-long bridge, that was located inside Bana Hills entertainment, was constructed at a height of 1.400 meters above sea level. Its gilded railing frame is the source of the moniker "Golden Bridge." Tourists throng to this location to take pictures at the spot that travel writers and journalists from across the world have praised as being as beautiful and impressive as a scene from "Game of Thrones" or "The Lord of the Rings." The vision of a massive pair of ancient hands—which like the hands of the Mountain God—lifting the bridge as a gleaming golden silk strip toward the deep green trees below is actually on par with any action-movie scene.

        <p>
            Two of the most picturesque locations in the entire north are Hoa Lu and Tam Coc, which are both nestled in Ninh Binh province, 100 kilometers southeast of Hanoi. Hoa Lu served as Vietnam's first capital between 968 and 1009 CE, a period of 41 years. It's widely said that Tam Coc, close by, is "Ha Long among the rice paddies." In the mouths of caves, visitors are driven by rowboat past green fields and the feet of mountains along the tranquil Tam Coc stream. Here, they discover fresh surprises like stalactites and stalagmites that glitter like gemstones just inches from the water.
